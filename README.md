# ðŸŽ§ Spotify Clone (Desktop)
This project is a clone of Spotify's old (and better) UI for desktop devices. I created this project to train my skills with `Tailwind CSS` using `Next JS` and `Typescript`. So, until I change my mind, it's just the home page with a few interactions.
My Spotify Clone is hosted with Vercel and you may access using the address [web-clone-spotify.vercel.app](https://web-clone-spotify.vercel.app/). Thanks for reading! ðŸ˜Ž
